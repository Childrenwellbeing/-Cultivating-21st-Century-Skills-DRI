There were numerous occasions when children eagerly posed in front of the camera, enthusiastic about documenting their lives. They expressed joy knowing that these moments were being captured. Perhaps they trusted us, believing we would eventually return all the recorded memories to them. I often wondered how they would react if they discovered they might never have access to their videos, realizing that once the project concluded, all recordings would be permanently erased. How would they feel? Would they still feel valued for being filmed and documented? The below excerpt “Did you tape me?” from Sorensen’s Ethics in Researching Young Children’s Play in Preschool (Sorensen, 2014) resonated deeply with me, as it echoed a frequent common conundrum I encountered in the Wellbeing project  (khavidaki 2024)]
